### Requirements

### Part 1

The "card" is a common user interface element that you will see on many webpages. A designer has given you one to build:

### Part 2: Structure

Work through these steps:

1. Create a wireframe of the card ([read about wireframing](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399))
1. Create an outline for your HTML from your wireframe
1. Build out the skeleton HTML inside an `index.html` file
1. Fill in the `body` element with the HTML for your card

### Part 3: Styling

Write the CSS rules in an external stylesheet to style the card so that it looks like the one in the mock-up.

Note, you may have to research some declarations! Here are three really good CSS

### Bonus: Naming CSS classes

Knowing what to name your CSS classes is tricky. You want something memorable and semantic, but you also don't want to waste a lot of time coming up with names for things. Because this is such a common problem, developers have come up with conventions for how they name their CSS classes. One of the best and most used conventions is called **BEM**, which stands for block, element, modifier.

Read the following two blog posts about BEM and then update your card to use the BEM syntax.
